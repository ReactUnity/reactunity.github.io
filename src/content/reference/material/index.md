ReactUnity provides some high level components out of the box to help developers generate UI quickly.
These components are styled with Material Design principles and will seem familiar to web and mobile developers.

This is a work in progress and development on this may or may not continue depending on the reception.

## Installation

It is available as [`@reactunity/material`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reactunity/material) on npm.

<PackageImport>

<TerminalBlock>

npm i @reactunity/material

</TerminalBlock>

```js
// Global styles is needed to be imported at least once for correct styling
import '@reactunity/material/styles';

// Importing a specific component:
import { Button } from '@reactunity/material';

// Importing all components together:
import * as Material from '@reactunity/material';
```

</PackageImport>
